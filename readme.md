# FiveM Door Hashes (webscraper)

This is a quick Python webscraper to get every door (and gate) hash from https://gtahash.ru.

## How To Use

You can use this in two ways:
* downloading/cloning this repo and running the python script
* copying the list from the doors.lua

Copying the list will usually do. I would recommend not going through the struggles of cloning the repo.
UNLESS this gets really outdated, then you should probably rescrape all the doors to make sure you're not missing too many.
